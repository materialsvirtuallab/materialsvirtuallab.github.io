# Office etiquette

* English is the language of international science and the language that is expected in all office conversations. You may use other languages for social interactions, but not for scientific discussions. It is to your benefit to practice conversing in English, whatever your comfort level is.
* Though we are a computational group, and I understand the desire to work from home from time to time, please note that you are expected to be in office during standard office hours (9am-5pm) most of the time. A major part of research is being present for discussions with your adviser and group members, which may take place on an ad-hoc basis.
* Doing a PhD is not just about research, but also about becoming a professional. That means professional standards of conduct applies. This means punctuality, properly managing the expectations of your adviser and colleagues, and delivering on your promises. If in doubt, consider what is acceptable in an future office environment with colleagues and bosses.

# Vacation policy

* All graduate students have officially two weeks of vacation per year, excluding US public holidays. However, this is negotiable depending on your research progress.
* The first thing you need to do is the submit a request for vacation (even if it is for a day) to your adviser. **Do not make any travel arrangements before approval has been given**.
* You are **not** expected to work while on vacation.
* However, if you will be away for an extended period (e.g., due to visa applications, etc.) exceeding reasonable vacation limits, you are expected to work while you are away. Under those circumstances, no excuses are accepted for work not being done. Examples of unacceptable excuses are you do not have a good internet connection, you are suffering from jet lag, you have personal/social commitments, etc. The professional gets the job done, regardless of circumstances.
* Upon vacation approval, you should enter the period that you are away in the MAVRL group calendar. This is so that the group can arrange to handle some of your responsibilities if needed.

# Leaving the group

* An exit interview will be conducted when you leave the group. You will have the opportunity to share his private thoughts on his experience in the group as well as providing suggestions for further improvement.
* The Morale Manager will set up a farewell dinner or social event. This should be set up close to the actual date of departure.
* Please note that we cannot authorize the removal of MAVRL-purchased equipment. This includes laptops. This is not because of the cost of the laptops, but rather it is an accounting requirement imposed by UCSD (think of your laptop as the equivalent of an XRD machine for an experimental lab). As for data, there are no problems with people bringing all data they have generated with them, e.g., by copying the data to a personal hard drive, subject to the understanding that Shyue Ping expects unfinished work to be completed even after that person leaves the group and that no data that is generated during the time within the group is published without his express permission. As for accounts, Shyue Ping is happy to continue maintaining access to computing resources, Dropbox, etc. for a period of up to one year after a person leaves if it is required for the completion of unfinished work. This can be arranged on a case-by-case basis. All Resource Managers (DB, Data, Computing, Software, etc.) are responsible for ensuring the user lists in their respective resources are up to date.
* The Web Manager should update the group web page to move the person to the alumni section.
