# Group jobs

Group jobs are technically not directly related to individual research, but nonetheless needs to be done to ensure the smooth functioning of the group as a whole. All group members are assigned at least one group job (no exceptions unless in extremely unusual circumstances).

As a MAVRL group member, you are expected to carry out your group job in a professional manner. That means you are held responsible for anything that happens in that area. It means that you do whatever is necessary to handle the day-to-day functions, and consult Shyue Ping if there are specific issues you cannot resolve. Shyue Ping will treat all non-performance in group jobs just as seriously as non-performance in research.
